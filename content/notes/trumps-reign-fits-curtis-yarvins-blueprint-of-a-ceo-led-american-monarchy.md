>This culture is already infiltrating Washington. Trump is governing like a monarch, making unilateral decisions via hundreds of executive orders, bulldozing through opposition and legislation.

>Musk and his DOGE minions stress they need to “delete entire agencies”, commandeering offices and allegedly stealing data under the pretext of eliminating “waste”.
>
>A recent study of over 500 political scientists found “the vast majority think the US is moving swiftly away from liberal democracy toward some form of authoritarianism”.

>In the vision laid out by Yarvin – and taken up more and more by a growing political vanguard – government is either a political inconvenience or a technical problem. Increasingly, the authoritarian imperative to impose absolute rule and the Silicon Valley mantra of “moving fast and breaking stuff” dovetail into a disturbing single directive.

This is the sort of stuff that makes you sound like a conspiracy theorist, but everyone involved in backing, supporting, and participating in the current regime has ties to this strange ideology. From what I can gather, it is an ideology of leaving the plebeians to die, while the tech billionaires rule over some little fiefdoms. All so they can 'innovate' without regulation.
