A little to the party on reading [Chris Coyier's take](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/02/28/where-im-at-on-the-whole-css-tricks-thing/) on CSS-Tricks post Digital Ocean purchase, but it's hard not to feel a little more sad about its current state.

> I got an email from a fella a while back who is now a VP of Content & Community at DigitalOcean who came over from the Cloudways acquisition. I think “ownership” of CSS-Tricks kinda fell is his lap after some internal shifts. Unlike his predecessors, he didn’t have any hangups about just talking directly to me. What he originally wanted was just to learn what it’s going to take to get spun back up and producing again.

Man, that would have been something.
