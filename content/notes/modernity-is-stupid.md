> We live in this godforsaken information ecosystem where more data than our puny little brains can handle in a lifetime bombard us every nanosecond, an increasing amount of it being spat out by Tormentus Scrapus™ sponsored by OpenAI and the devaluation of all creative labour, and trying to be a conscientious and thoughtful consumer of information is exhausting, not letting your entire capacity for critical thought be suborned by cascading skinner boxes of shitty incentives and UI anti-patterns takes active fucking effort, and I am trying so hard to click “reject all” on every metaphorical cookie banner in my life, and now this??
