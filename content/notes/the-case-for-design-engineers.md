> For responsive design, there are Too. Many. Artifacts. You’ve got sketches and wireframes and mockups and prototypes. And for each of those you need at least three variations: “desktop”, “tablet” and “mobile” (whatever those mean). As the article suggests, you could be looking at up to 60 artifacts per design iteration. It’s ludicrous.

How? They have an understanding of the constraints of the medium, so from sketches to wireframe to high fidelity mocks, they only have to produce one or two artifacts while simultaneously keeping a picture in their head of how the elements of those designs flex and flow and change across different sizes.

A compelling argument, I think, for a design engineering role.
