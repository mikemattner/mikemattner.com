Dave Rupert [wrote something](https://daverupert.com/2025/08/the-economy-he-died-five-years-ago/) that really speaks to me concerning the economy:

> That scene in the rotunda reinforced my belief the economy was already dead. If Big Tech is clinging to government contracts and quid pro quo perks, then we must be out of ideas. Every time the winds of fortune change, everyone points their boats in the same direction. In a healthy, living economy shouldn’t there be more than one lake to fish in? Instead of asking “What doesn’t exist and would be useful?” and investing in that, it’s about “How can I extract the most money from hot new tech?” Instead of “What’s quality?” and chasing that, it’s “How can we move fast and make breakable things?”

Which, honestly, I think really gets after the problem&mdash;the only drive to build seems to be money.
