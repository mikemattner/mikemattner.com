An [incredibly useful resource](http://abovethefold.fyi/) to have handy when discussing ‘the fold’ with clients. Guys, it’s not a thing anymore. Stop trying to make the fold happen.

Users scroll and instinctively know that they should do that. Yes consider content placement and importance. Don’t try to fit it all on one screen.
