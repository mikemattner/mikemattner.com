In the setup for this [great interview](https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/707010/gil-duran-the-nerd-reich-tech-billionaires-authoritarianism-dictator) with Gil Duran.

> The “Nerd Reich,” as Gil sees it, is a web of powerful, ultrawealthy tech billionaires. People like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, and others, whose politics and influence now see them pushing the country further and further away from democracy and toward something resembling a kind of [cross between unrestrained capitalism and monarchy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/opinion/peter-thiel-antichrist-ross-douthat.html).

> This idea has been kicking around for quite a while now. You’ll hear Gil refer to it as the Dark Enlightenment, or as some refer to it, the neo-reactionary movement. Some central characters here include [Curtis Yarvin](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/09/curtis-yarvin-profile) — an influential, anti-democracy blogger whose ideas once stood far outside mainstream acceptability, but who recently has [captured the attention of politicians like Vice President JD Vance](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24266512/jd-vance-curtis-yarvin-influence-rage-project-2025).

> Now that these ideas have entered the White House by way of the MAGA movement, Gil argues that it has created a dangerous coalition between the far right and the stewards of the biggest, most popular tech platforms and products. After all, as we’ve seen with Elon Musk and DOGE, these tech billionaires aren’t just sitting in the shadows; they want to tear down and rebuild the government from the ground up.

What stands out to me quite a bit about this whole situation is--as was pointed out--the lack of traction any of this has in the media as a whole. At least outside of a few publications, most have taken to interviewing Yarvin as if he's just a run of the mill political philosopher and all of these ideas as just another approach to American governance worthy of inclusion in the debate.
