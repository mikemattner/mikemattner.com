Via [Kottke](https://kottke.org/25/10/what-makes-for-a-healthy-society), "Malcolm Margolin shared a list of what he thought constituted a healthy society," and a few stood out to me:

> * Sustainable relationship with the environment. In a healthy society, the present generation doesnâ€™t strip-mine the soil, water, forest, minerals, etc., leaving the future impoverished and the beauty of the world degraded.
> * Relative egalitarianism. The gap between those with the most wealth and power and those with the least should be moderate, and those with the least should feel protected, cared for, or rewarded in some other way.
> * Economic security attained through networks of family, friendship, and social reciprocity rather than through the individual hoarding of goods.
