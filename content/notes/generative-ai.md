Generative AI is like the ultimate idea guy’s idea! Imagine… if all they needed to create a business, software or art was their great idea, and a computer. No need to engage (or pay) any of those annoying makers who keep talking about limitations, scope, standards, artistic integrity etc. etc.

The whole write-up is how I have felt (even down to the folks getting my take an some idea they have for an app), but the idea in particular&mdash;that implementation was the only thing getting in the way of their grand vision being successful&mdash;that they can use AI to eliminate this stupid little hindrance has rubbed me the wrong way from the &ldquo;thought leaders&rdquo; in the industry.
