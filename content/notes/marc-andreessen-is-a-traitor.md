Adam Gurri [writes](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/marc-andreessen-is-a-traitor/):

> A recent leak of venture capitalist Marc Andreessen’s group chats has revealed that he’s quite happy to see our university system destroyed if it will keep out foreigners and humiliate the elites who “actively discriminated against” people like him. The messages are at times quite shockingly racist in their content, referencing how “the combination of DEI and immigration” are “two forms of discrimination” that “systematically cut most of the children of the Trump voter base out of any realistic prospect of access to higher education and corporate America.”
>
> Less shocking but no less notable is his contempt for elite centers of learning. He declares “Stanford and MIT as mainly political lobbying operations fighting American innovation at this point,” a remarkably delusional statement. Andreessen has made no secret of the fact that he feels he and his tech oligarch peers have been betrayed by elite institutions and the Democratic party. But the reality is that they are the ones who have betrayed not only their country, but the very system which made their fortune and status possible.

>They have betrayed the society that enriched them, and have put us at serious risk of authoritarianism, ethnic cleansing, lawlessness, and stagnation. They have betrayed the values that made that society great, values which they apparently only ever held superficially because they believed it would make them appear respectable. They can no longer be trusted. When the wheel turns once again, the matter of their treachery must be revisited, and a new arrangement must be reconstructed from the wreckage of the old one.

Just an excellent article around.
