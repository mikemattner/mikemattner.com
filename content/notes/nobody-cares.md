Grant Slatton captures a lot of what society in the US feels like right now: [Nobody Cares](https://grantslatton.com/nobody-cares).

> I've met a few people that work for municipal governments. Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.

There's no sense of community. Society isn't working towards our mutually benefit. We're so caught up our own individual journeys that it doesn't even cross our minds to do some task just a little bit better for the benefit of those around us. With what's to come, its hard to argue with the sentiment.
