There's no question about it, I sat on this site for a year kind of waiting for [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com)'s release. I've officially worked with Vue 3 in a professional capacity for the vast majority of that time, and I probably could have continued to add content here, but alas I just couldn't bring myself to work on anything after-hours.

I am now in the process of building out the content for writing content and I'm looking to bring links back, but as more of a top level category/page rather than an integration of my blogish content. One of the last pieces I'll probably bring back is my project list combined with some of my previous portfolio pieces&mdash;as dated as those might be by that time.

Hey there! I'm also adding some new content components to add additional context in my writing.

As with most of these sorts of build outs these days, I'm doing this out in the open! Hopefully I stick with it for a change!
