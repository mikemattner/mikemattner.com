> All along, Trump seemed like a twisted caricature of every rotten reflex of the radical right. That he has prevailed, that he has won this election, is a crushing blow to the spirit; it is an event that will likely cast the country into a period of economic, political, and social uncertainty that we cannot yet imagine. That the electorate has, in its plurality, decided to live in Trump’s world of vanity, hate, arrogance, untruth, and recklessness, his disdain for democratic norms, is a fact that will lead, inevitably, to all manner of national decline and suffering.

I wake up this morning disgusted by what happened last night. What the election of Trump meant had little to do with Republicans versus Democrats, but signaled something even more troubling about the psyche and makeup of a group that feels marginalized.

I’m not happy that I now have a Trump tag (editor: not anymore) on my blog. Jesus.
